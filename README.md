## Anxiety reducing timer experiment

Something I've always struggled with is watching a ticking clock. I find myself staring at the timer instead of focusing on the task at hand. Because of this, techniques like Pomodoro do not work for me. I'm always checking in on how much time is left. Or I'm trying to beat it which turns out to be trying to beat myself.

This timer takes the timer out of the equation. Instead, you just get a swirl of background colors to let you know that it's running, and then a meditation bell sound when the time is up.

That's it.

I like to use it when going into a flow state with work, to make sure I don't get trapped in a hyper focus rabbit hole. Or I'll set it for a 15 minute brain rest.
